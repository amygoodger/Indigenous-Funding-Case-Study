It reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The committee was surprised and disappointed to observe the passive approach the government appears to be taking in relation to the cancellation. While the abrupt cancellation of the 2026 Commonwealth Games is not the Australian government’s fault, the consequences affect Australia’s reputation and therefore there is a role for the Australian government to get active in trying to find a solution.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The committee, chaired by the Nationals senator <strong>Matt Canavan</strong>, said it had not reached a review on an alternative city that could host the games, but noted the local government in the Gold Coast was interested:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>This is a matter for the Australian government to evaluate. However, given the constrained timeframe to salvage the games, and concurrent fiscal and cost of living pressures, the committee endorses the principle that alternative options should maximise the use of existing sporting, transport and housing infrastructure across Australia.</em></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-09-14T06:58:56.037Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6502a91b8f0873945374f3b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jordyn-beazley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-09-14T06:34:32.061Z\">7.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A big thank you to <strong>Amy Remeikis</strong> for guiding us through the last sitting fortnight.

And one I can say very clearly is that the principles of the voice are agreed to. And they outline clearly their way in which the voice will be have gender parity. In fact it’s not a new idea and didn’t come about in the last 12 months. It was something that was very heavily suggested in the <strong>Julian Leeser-Patrick Dodson</strong> inquiry some years ago. It is important that we have gender parity. It is not difficult to achieve.</p> <p>The most important thing about this voice is, as the prime minister has said, it is an advisory body to the parliament.</p> <p>It’s the third part of the amendment also says that you – everyone in this chamber, in this house – will have a role in determining the scope and the function and how the voice will operate. <strong>This is an important point. I will just reiterate the voice is advisory, it will not deliver programs and it has no veto power.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-09-14T04:58:34.116Z\">at 5.58am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-65028cb58f0873945374f303\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-09-14T04:38:10.715Z\">5.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Liberal MP <strong>Angie Bell</strong> asks <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> one of the staple opposition questions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What areas of government policies do not effect Indigenous Australians?</p> </blockquote> <p>Albanese starts with the usual answer (which is reading the question) and there are a whole heap of the usual “point of order, is he being relevant” “point of order, yes” back and forth, and there are so many interjections that Albanese can barely get out a line before someone is called to order.</p> <p><strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> is made to withdraw a comment (which I didn’t catch) and the answer comes to its conclusion – but we have all seen this dance before.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-09-14T04:56:08.705Z\">at 5.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-65028c5b8f0873945374f301\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-09-14T04:31:04.663Z\">5.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The housing dixer answers have been too much for the shadow housing minister and he has now been booted under 94A.</p> <p>I still remain unconvinced that being put in a time out from the chamber is a punishment, but here we are. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-65028bbf8f0873945374f2fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-09-14T04:29:39.893Z\">5.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just some modern history which might be relevant today – here is a story <strong>Lorena Allam</strong> reported in 2022:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/attempted-aboriginal-massacres-took-place-as-recently-as-1981-historian-says\">Attempted Aboriginal massacres took place as recently as 1981, historian says</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Attempts at the mass killing of Aboriginal people were still being made as recently as 1981, according to a historian who has spent the past four years researching colonial violence in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory\">Northern Territory</a>.</p> <p>Dr Robyn Smith, who has worked on the University of Newcastle’s <a href=\"https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/\">colonial frontier massacres map project</a>, says she has also found attempts at massacres in the 1930s and 40s.</p> <p>These horrors are not on the map because fewer than six people died – the research team’s strict criterion for inclusion.

The power of its ideas. Has no right of veto, has no capacity to direct the government or direct the parliament. The primacy of the parliament is there. I think it’s a pity that, these interjections occur. Consistent with what Michael said this morning, in his letter, former prime minister Howard was asked Australians ‘to maintain the rage’.

Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) and the Victorian Ombudsman tabled a progress report on their Operation Watts investigation in parliament on Thursday.</p> <p>The joint inquiry examined the practice of branch stacking in the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor party, which resulted in the alleged misuse of public funds for party political purposes and subversion of parliamentary standards and processes.</p> <p>It made 21 recommendations that were accepted by premier, <strong>Daniel Andrews</strong>, who provided the Department of Parliamentary Services with $8.52m to implement the changes. A team was also set up within the Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPC) to draft necessary law changes.</p> <p>The agencies, however, say the government hasn’t given them a timeframe to introduce a bill to parliament, nor provided them with a draft. The progress report states:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More than a year has elapsed since our recommendations to establish a Parliamentary Ethics Committee and the Parliamentary Integrity Commissioner were accepted. DPC has assured us that the enabling legislation is being worked on, but it has not yet indicated a timeframe for its introduction to parliament beyond reiterating the government’s commitment to implement key reforms by June 2024.</p> </blockquote> <p>The agencies also say despite a commitment from the premier to consult with MPs from all parties on the changes in 2023, this hasn’t occurred.</p> <p>The report states that for any reforms to be implemented by mid-2024, the legislation will have to pass parliament by December this year, which is looking unlikely:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the usual timeframe for the creation of new statutory bodies and the commitments set out above, it seems unlikely the government will meet its deadline.

I’m Martin Farrer and I’ve got some of our top overnight stories before Amy Remeikis picks up the slack in a short while.</p> <p>Our top story this morning shows that the regulators responsible for keeping tabs on Qantas are among those C-suite bosses granted access to Australia’s invite-only Chairman’s Lounge, a luxurious and controversial perk the airline gives to influential policymakers.

The Guardian is not suggesting they have any conflict of interest but the story raises concerns about the airline’s soft power influence.</p> <p>There’s some dispiriting news for supporters of the Indigenous voice to parliament with our story that polls suggest the proposal looks increasingly likely to be rejected in next month’s referendum, with models estimating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2023/sep/14/indigenous-voice-to-parliament-no-campaign-leading-in-every-state-poll-analysis-shows\">the no campaign is leading in every state</a>.
